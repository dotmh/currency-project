# Language Learning Scenario

## About

I enjoy learning new languages in pursuit of that goal I came up with a basic scenario that I could use to explore new languages and frameworks.

The idea of the scenario is that it is simple enough to not require in depth knowledge of the language so making it easier to learn the language. It also can cover some common tasks that I would need to do as a front end developer.

## The Scenario

You have returned from a 2 week trip in Japan. You didn't spend all the money that you convert to the Japanese Yen (¥) to take with you. You there for have a wallet fall of Japanese currency. The task is to covert the ¥ amount back to British Pound Sterling (£).

### The code should

1. take in the amount of each coin or note that you have.
2. show a summary of the wallet totals i.e. how much value of each coin or note you have
3. get the total in ¥
4. get the current exchange rate from [Free Currency API](https://freecurrencyapi.com) for ¥ to £.
5. display the total in ¥ and in £ to 2 decimal places.

### Wallet Contents

#### Notes

- 5 x ¥10,000 notes
- 1 x ¥5000 note
- 5 \* ¥1000 notes

#### Coins

- 1 x ¥500 coin
- 4 x ¥100 coins
- 5 x ¥50 coins
- 8 x ¥10 coins
- 7 x ¥5 coins
- 14 x ¥1 coins
